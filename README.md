# Ynab

A read-only library to access your YNAB 4 data files.

## Contributing

Note: This is still very much a work-in-progress. The API will likely change in sweeping ways prior to 1.0. I am parsing the entire JSON budget file and storing some transactions but very little else. Feel free to send pull requests or file issues if you have something you'd like to be working ahead of everything else.

Check out `spec/functional/ynab_spec.rb` for example usage and pending tests.
